I am living in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.  

I decided to come to the North of England to see if it is the place for me to live long term.  I am thinking hard about how I want to spend my time and the projects that I'm most excited about.  I want to create delightful things that make other people happy and find ways to share those, sometimes in person and sometimes online.  I want to learn about how creative things are built, especially art made from ideas, like jokes, puzzles or pieces of music.

I'm doing a lot of walking and listening to books on the creative process. I'm also really enjoying books by people who don't take the world at face value and really question how and why they do the things they do.  I am inspired by those who have learned to live life on their own terms, figuring out their values and living them each day.
